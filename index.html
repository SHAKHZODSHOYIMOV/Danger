    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. It was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum in the Netherlands and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Python is known for its use of whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks instead of using curly braces or keywords like 'end', which makes it more readable and pleasant to work with for many programmers. Python can be used in a wide range of applications, from scientific computing to web development and data analysis. It is widely used in industry and academia.</p>

            <li>The tool is used to create and execute a Dangerfile.py in the root directory of a repository, which sets up rules for the review process. The danger-python script is executed after the test suite in the CI process</li>
            <li>The tool helps to automate and streamline common code review chores, making it easier for teams to review and approve code changes.</li>
